# Data Science for Staking

* Published on: 2022-07-22 (we expect the challenge to ready for the participants on 2022-07-22; until then it is considered a draft and minor changes may occur)
* Updated on: 2022-07-22
* Submitted by: LiNEAR
* Rewards: 20 Delegated NEAR Points (DNP)

### Description:

Blockchain is big data. We believe that very interesting data insights could be found out through investigating staking data on NEAR. Please try to find out some valuable data from staking and validators and build a visualized data dashboard for everyone to access.

If you don’t have anything in mind to start with, please consider the follow examples:

- Lifecycle performance of validators. (How many blocks have they produced, did they ever get kicked out, etc..)
- How does the reward APY change from epoch to epoch, what is affecting it?
- The token flow of big delegation whales. When did they decide to stake and when did they unstake.
- Historical data of the number of delegators (and delegation amount) on each validator node.

### Deliverable

- A chartio-like data dashboard, a report built with Jupyter Notebook, or a well-structured spreadsheet. You're encouraged to use whatever data visualization tool or machine learning algorithm that you love. 
- A brief summary of what we could learn from those data and how NEAR can use those data to improve staking.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Please provide data insights other than what we can directly get from the NEAR explorer / NEAR wallet.
- As for the outcome, a visualized data dashboard is preferred, also a spreadsheet with well-structured data is also acceptable.
- What we can learn from the data actually matters, so please also provide a summary of how you interpret the data and how we can improve the NEAR system based on your work.
- Analytics with NEAR mainnet data is strongly recommended. You can also analyze data from testnet or shardnet, but mainnet have more real and complex transactions. 

### Judging Criteria

- A clear and meaningful goal is set. (What kind of data are you investigating and what kind of result are you expecting) (2 points)
- Being able to correctly and effectively grab the data from indexer, rpc-node, etc. (2 points)
- Transform and aggregate the data to form the final result. (3 points)
- A straightforward data dashboard. (3 points)
